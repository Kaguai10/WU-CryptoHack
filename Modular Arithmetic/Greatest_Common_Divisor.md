The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), sometimes known as the highest common factor, is the largest number which divides two positive integers `(a,b)`.

For `a=12,b=8` we can calculate the divisors of `a: {1,2,3,4,6,12}` and the divisors of `b: {1,2,4,8}`. Comparing these two, we see that `gcd⁡(a,b)=4`.

Now imagine we take `a=11,b=17`. Both `a` and `b` are prime numbers. As a prime number has only itself and `1` as divisors, `gcd⁡(a,b)=1`.

We say that for any two integers `a,b` if `gcd⁡(a,b)=1` then `a` and `b` are coprime integers.

If `a` and `b` are prime, they are also coprime. If `a` is prime and `b<a` then `a` and `b` are coprime.

><strong>Think about the case for `a` prime and `b>a`, why are these not necessarily coprime?</strong>

There are many tools to calculate the GCD of two integers, but for this task we recommend looking up <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm> Euclid's Algorithm.</a>

Try coding it up; it's only a couple of lines. Use  `a=12,b=8` to test it.

Now calculate `gcd⁡(a,b)` for `a=66528,b=52920` and enter it below. 

## Solve
`solver.py`
```python
def gcd(a,b):
     if a<b:
          a,b = b,a
     while b!=0:
          a,b = b,a%b
     return a
print(gcd(66528,52920))
```

run => `python3 solver.py`

Flag: `1512`
